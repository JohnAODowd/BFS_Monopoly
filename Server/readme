The game is divided up into four states, LOBBY, PLAYING, AUCTION, and FINISHED.

These states are used to abstract the API requests.

*PING request is used in all states, it's used to poll the server every state*

Ping ->

    {  
    "uID":"13a8ba65a19ec410fa3fd7e585e7b924274458966b8d726b3837adcdab862b4d",
    "request":"PING",
    "gID":"11c5d71aa790cc4ab0da3cdf8e91972f6e35c400fac8b03d6852e06c2573206d"
	}
	

Lobby:

The lobby State is the first state and consists of 5 types of API calls. 
In this state, users get back 4 objects in every request sent : "game, player, players, options"
users get a gID and uID when hosting or joining a game.

"HOST" -> When someone wants to start a new game:
	
	{
	'request' 	: "HOST",
	'name'		: "hosty",
	"type" 		: "private" 	/*games can be public or private*/
	}


"JOIN" -> sent when someone wants to join a game: 


Private Join -> Used for joining a game

*A gID is needed if joining a private game, hosts of private games must send it to the joiners (link).*

	{  
	"gID"		: "11c5d71aa790cc4ab0da3cdf8e91972f6e35c400fac8b03d6852e06c2573206d",
	"name"		: "Joiner1",
	"request"	: "JOIN"
	}

Public Join -> No gID is needed when joining a public game, as you're put in a random public game.

		{  
    	"name"		: "Joiner1",
    	"request"	: "JOIN"
		}

    "request"	: "FIGURINE",

	}


PLAYING:

In this state you will get the same objects as the LOBBY state, plus 3 more, chat, deeds, and board.
